## Purpose of this bot
This bot is for discord only. The advantage of this bot is, that it will list you all sales (for example some steam sales or something similar) of games that are currently saved. You can even add sales
that you find in the internet.

## Functions of this bot
The prefix of this bot is "$". That means that you need to type "$" before each command. If you type "$help" you get a list of all commands.
By typing "$sales" you get a list of all sales that are currently saved.
By typing "$addsale <salelink> <enddate of the sale with YYYY-MM-DD> <name of the game>" you can add a sale by yourself. (salelink=the link where you can find the
sale; enddate of the sale=the date the sale ends; name of the game=the name of the game)
